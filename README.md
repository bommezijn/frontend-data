# Frontend Data

This repo will be my journey through the visualisation of data with JavaScript. Specifically with a framework called [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). The goal of this seminar would be to create such visualisation with data from an API and interact with it.

This course is specifically given by the Hogeschool van Amsterdam CMD. More information about the course specifically can be found at [CMDA-TT's github](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-21-22).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Conventions
For GIT I am using the a convention called gitmojis. The convention is to structure your GIT commits but also to visually see what a commit does without reading the commit.

To read more about this convention visit [the repo](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji).
## Run Locally
First, run the development server:

```BASH
# We suggest that you begin by typing:  
  cd ../frontend-data
  yarn dev

  # Starts the development server.
  yarn dev

  # Builds the app for production.
  yarn build

  # Runs the built app in production mode.
  yarn start


```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

<!-- 
[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details. -->
