# Frontend Data

This repo will be my journey through the visualisation of data with JavaScript. Specifically with a framework called [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). The goal of this seminar would be to create such visualisation with data from an API and interact with it.

This course is specifically given by the Hogeschool van Amsterdam CMD. More information about the course specifically can be found at [CMDA-TT's github](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-21-22).

### Conventions
For GIT I am using the a convention called gitmojis. The convention is to structure your GIT commits but also to visually see what a commit does without reading the commit.

To read more about this convention visit [the repo](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji).
